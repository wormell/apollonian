# apollonian

Code for computing the Hausdorff dimension of the Apollonian circle packing

The code has two parts, a non-rigorous step where you find a dimension and eigenvalue estimate, and a rigorous step where you certify it.
## apollonian-nonrigorous
This code takes one argument: the number of bits in the `BigFloat` precision. So far the highest we've run it is 448 bits (at which point memory on our research server started to be a problem). You run the code for NBITS-bit arithmetic as follows:

``` julia apollonian-nonrigorous.jl NBITS ```

This program finds a good dimension estimate iteratively using the secant method: it tells you what numbers it gets as it goes in `apollonian-nonrigorous-NBITS.log`
Eventually spits out a JLD file called `apollonian-nonrigorous-NBITS.jld` containing a bunch of relevant data including the dimension estimate and eigenfunction estimate.

Then to validate it, you make sure this file is in the same folder as `apollonian-rigorous.jl` and call

``` julia apollonian-rigorous.jl NBITS ```

This then does all the rigorously validated min-max stuff, and prints out a Theorem into `apollonian-rigorous-NBITS.log`.

With `NBITS=448`, you should get

```
